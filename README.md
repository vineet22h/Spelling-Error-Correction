# Spelling-Error-Correction
The spelling Error Correction System is all about correcting a given miss-spelled sentence system. In which we implemented 9 different models for character based LSTM models such as :
1. Seq2Seq Model
2. Seq2Seq Model with Attention Mechanism.
3. Seq2Seq Bidirectional LSTM Model with Attention Mechanism.
The each architecture is trained for 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-gram words.
We obtained best results on trigram Seq2Seq Bidirectional LSTM Model With Attention Mechanism by achieving best BLEU Score of 0.97 on out test dataset.

# Business Problem: 
By building the automated spelling error correction. We can create
automated tools for writing English scientific texts, Filtering out sentences that need
spelling improvements, evaluating articles, etc. These all mentioned tasks are done
manually so, by automating this process we can save both time and money for the
company.
